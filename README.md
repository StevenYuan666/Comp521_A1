# First Personal Shooting Game with Randomly Generated Maze
## Overall Design
The main, static play area consists of a large rectangular area, styled as an outdoor terrain (i.e., include some low-height vegetation), fully surrounded by impassible terrain (moun- tains or walls) to ensure the player does not leave the area. The overall area is divided into two, disjoint areas (a starting area and a goal area) due to a deep and wide canyon; proportionally, the starting area occupies roughly about 50% of the level area, the chasm 30%, and the goal area 20%.

The player will be spawned in one of the corners of the starting area, and has a goal of getting to the area across the chasm. The goal point is visually obvious. The player is able to move around freely in the starting area, at least within the first 1/2 of the starting area. As the player approaches the canyon, however, some number of trees are dynamically instantiated, semi-blocking access to the canyon. This forested area is a few trees deep, and consists of 30 trees.
The player has the ability to fire projectiles, which can be used to destroy individual trees. Player projectiles are visible objects moving rapidly (but noticeably) in a straight line out from the player in the direction of the camera. A projectile destroys the first tree it encounters. Only one projectile may exist at a time, and projectiles disappear upon hitting a tree, going out of bounds (including hitting the ground or going too high up), or if they go into the canyon area.

Once at the canyon, the player is able to observe a “bridge” across the canyon, but well below the cliff edge. The bridge itself is covered by short walls (high enough to prevent moving over, but low enough to see across) defining a grid- based perfect maze, 6 cells wide, and 12 cells long. The maze is constructed dynamically—each tree destroyed adds one complete row, starting from the player side. Thus upon getting through the forest the player find just one with only a partially constructed maze, depending on how many trees they removed initially; once the maze is completed destroying further trees has no effect. Include walls on the sides of the bridge to prevent the player from falling off.

The player can walk off the cliff at any time. If they fall into the canyon itself, or onto an incomplete bridge-maze the game ends. If they fall onto the bridge with a completed maze they may begin to navigate the maze from wherever they land. Reaching any cell in the ending row of the maze should result in them teleporting up the goal area. If they jump/fall back into the canyon from the goal side, whether they land on the bridge or not, it is a game failure. Once they reach the goal location itself, the game ends with a conspicuous indication of success.
